# Cartoonify-GIFs
    The project aims to develop an algorithm that can transform real-world images and videos into cartoon-style.
    The resulting cartoon-style images and videos can have applications in various fields, such as creating cartoon avatars, visual effects in movies, and video games.
    The algorithm will use several image processing techniques to achieve the cartoon effect.
    The image processing techniques include edge detection, color histogram calculation, and K-Means clustering.
    Non-local Means Denoising will be used to remove any noise in the input video frames before applying the cartoon effect.
